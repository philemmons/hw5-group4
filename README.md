# Homework 5 - Chat Bot

Heroku url: https://hw5-group4-chatapp.herokuapp.com/

## Teammates and Parts We Did:

* Phillip Emmons - Set up the socket.io, server, client, and set up outline of chat.
* Jessie Dowding - Looked into setting up with react, readme, and fixed styling/scroll bar.
* Samba Diallo -
* Regie Daquiong - The looks of the chat room.

## Strategy for Handling the “Interfaces” Between Each Other’s Code -

* Ensuring that we add, commit, and push our code after making changes
* Ensuring that what we have on cloud9 is up to date (i.e. pulling new code from the repo)
* Setting clear guidelines as to who is going to do what

## Known Problems -

* One of the known problems of homework 5 is if you have the chat open in 2 tabs, <br> it registers you as 2 different users
* The table headings, specifically "users", doesn't adjust to the width of the users.

## What we Could Improve -

* To improve our project we could add authentification to the chat room.
* Once authentification is added, we can then autofill the username of the person who is on the chat.
* Perhaps, add an anonymous feature - so users aren't required to login if they don't want to.

## To Run the Program Locally -

* In Cloud9 open your terminal and run: git clone https://github.com/philemmons/hw5-group4
* Navigate to the "hw5-group4" folder
* Open `server.js` and start the app by clicking on the "Run" button in the top menu.
* Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

* Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9users.io/'.

## Note For Running Locally-

You may need to run the following command if the node_modules aren't installed: 'npm install'
